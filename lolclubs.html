        Introduction
    </h2>

    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "col-lg-12 textBox">
            In 2016, Riot Games launched clubs as a way for League of Legends players to make friends and interact with other players. Joining a club provided a unique way of expressing a group of people with club tags. Since I am a passionate League of Legends player, I committed myself to revamping League of Legends clubs to increase social activity within the client. Everything in this project is done solely by me and does not represent the League of Legends brand.

    <h2>
        The Problem
    </h2>

    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "col-lg-12 textBox">
            Clubs have had minimal support from Riot with the only update within the past three years being raising the maximum cap of members from 50 to 100. Clubs so far have only been valued as a way to show a secondary "in game name" with the unique club tags. Many clubs have little to no internal activity, and other than obtaining the club tag, there is no other incentive to join one.

            <div>
                A recent post on the League of Legends subreddit about the current state of clubs has brought up a discussion of what features people would like to see implemented and complaints that they have about clubs. I used this post, along with opinions from friends that play League of Legends, to conduct my user research. You can view this post
                <a class = "creditlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/covk54/clubs_are_the_opposite_of_what_they_are_ment_to_be/">
                    here</a>.
            </div>
            <div class = "break2">
                The top two comments on the reddit post state that
            </div>
            <div class = "break2">
                <span class = "emphasize">"all the clubs i'm in have almost zero chatting going even when they are fully populated"</span>
            </div>

            <div class = "break2">
                <span class = "emphasize">"Got to say, Riot's biggest failure is the social aspect of this game. I've been playing for 4 years now I think.. I can't recall the last time I actually chatted with anybody in this game."</span>
            </div>
            <div class = "break2">
                Clubs have been promoted as a "social hub [that] facilitates friendships and naturally provides a place to organize games.", but according to testimonies from the comment chains, clubs have not been used for that purpose.
            </div>
            <div class = "break2">
                People also voiced out their opinion on wanting a way to search for clubs. "Clubs need to be searchable and clubs need an option to allow you to join openly without an invite."
            </div>
            <div class = "break2">
                After interviewing my friends(who are all active League of Legends players) on their perspective of clubs, I found out that a vast majority of them joined a club for the club tag. None of them could remember the last time they actually chatted with another via the club chat function.

            I decided to create a list of the current and possible features that the redesign could have. I made sure to make sure to brainstorm features that would facilitate social interaction. This redesign is from the point of view of any club member rather than the owner of the club who would have access to certain settings.
