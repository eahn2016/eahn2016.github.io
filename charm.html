              <p>
                The Center for Hard to Recycle Materials (CHaRM) needs an effective way to track the number of people who visit the recycling facility and the materials they bring in order to receive funding from the city of Atlanta. Their previous method, recording with pen and paper, overburdened the small number of staff. My team, consisting of me, Pranay Kumar, Adya Moti, Arianna Pathammavong, and Annette Cochran, will create an iOS application for CHaRM and its visitors that facilitates this data collection by providing an intuitive user interface for visitors and admin account functionality while providing access to raw data and data visualization features. The application will also collect zip code data which will show areas where visitors predominantly travel from. This provides evidence for CHaRM to receive funding from the city of Atlanta to open a second facility in a popular location. In addition, the application will serve as a platform for communication between CHaRM and its visitors, including up-to-date facility closures and information about recycling. This project is a <span style="color: #ff0000"><b>work in progress</b></span> and will continuously be updated.

              <h5 class = "text-center">Surveys</h5>
              <p>
                The goal of the survey is to learn more about their experience at CHaRM, such as how often they visit and the types of materials they bring with them to recycle. Knowing the process that they go through every time they visit CHaRM will help us to design our app in such a way that makes the entire process easier and more streamlined. For example, knowing whether the majority of people coming to CHaRM are are new or repeat visitors will help us tailor the features of the application accordingly. One-time visitors would benefit from a map of the facility and would not want to make an account, while repeat visitors would benefit from an account to keep track of their recycling and reduce the amount of data entry in the application each time they visit the facility.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also wanted to know more about user demographics, such as education level and age. This information is important to know when designing our application because their level of education and age may correlate to how comfortable they are with technology and using apps on their phones. Level of education would also inform our decisions of what facts and statistics about recycling we display on the application. Also, if we can identify a trend between education level and the users who come to recycle, it will help us to better identify our primary users. Similarly, knowing their age will also help us gauge our usersâ€™ familiarity with technology and how they will interact with the app, while also helping us better identify our primary users.
