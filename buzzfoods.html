            <p>
              I, along with Bryanna Lawton, Vicky Chung, and Naren Dikkala, was tasked with finding and solving a problem in the "sharing economy" - a system that will help both producers and consumers receive what they each want.

            <h3 class="text-uppercase mb-3 text-center">The Problem</h3>
            <p>
              A lot of students at Georgia Tech purchase meal plans, particularly freshmen, who are required to purchase one. At current rates, freshmen are required to pay $2,420 per semester for a meal plan. This is a significant amount of money, considering that tuition for a full-time in-state undergraduate student is $5,004 (also at current rates). A meal plan is 48% of the cost of tuition, yet the value proposition is questionable because meal swipes expire at the end of each semester. So per annum, freshman must pay $4,840 for 700 meals, and cannot redeem any value if they do not use these meals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Presently, students who are running out of time to use meal swipes have few options. Many try to buy food from Chik-fil-A or Panda Express, as these two outlets accept meal swipes towards the end of the semester. However, this is limited to one swipe per day, and has a value of $7, versus a retail value of up to $15 for a meal swipe at dinner time. Additionally, fast food is not healthy, so students are loading up on unhealthy food before finals, which is not good for academic performance. Another possibility is that students may try to give meal swipes to their friends, but they might not have many friends who lack meal plans (if they are freshman) or their friends may also be stuck with extra meals, or may not be interested in meals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our goal is to design a system which will allow students to share meal swipes they don’t plan on using with other students. The producers would be those who are on the meal plan or have meal swipes, while the consumers would be those who are not on the meal plan and do not have meal swipes.

              <h5 class = "text-center">Surveys</h5>
              <p>
                We sent out a survey to our friends at Georgia Tech and also posted it in Georgia Tech Facebook groups. The survey isolated the meal plan participants from non-meal plan participants through a series of conditional questions. As part of the survey we recorded the class standing, gender, and residence area (on or off campus) in the event that statistically significant correlations between any of these factors and meal plan preferences could be found. Because anyone involved in paying for a meal plan is a stakeholder in the problem area, we asked meal plan holders how their meal plan was funded. Similarly, we asked non-meal plan holders if the cost of a meal plan played a part in their decision to not sign up for a meal plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                To determine if there was potential to address dissatisfaction on the part of the non-meal plan holding consumers, we asked them to indicate how satisfied they were with their current food arrangements, which could comprise cooking at home, eating out, or some other system. The idea behind this was that respondees who were not satisfied with their current food plans would be more open to changing the way they get their food than someone who doesn’t feel like making any changes.

            <h3 class="text-uppercase mb-3 text-center">The Solution</h3>
            <p>
              In the beginning of this project, we wanted consumers to be able to purchase meal swipes at a much reduced rate from producers. However, after talking with GT Dining services, we learned that Meal swipes are tax-exempt and the person who buys them has tax implications that are non-transferable. However, there are ways to circumvent these rules without breaking them, i.e, limiting the amount of meal swipes one can donate. With this in mind we modified the donation solution to limit the number of swipes the users can donate. The swipes they donate are part of a “Guest Meal Plan Swipe,” which are swipes specifically set aside for donating. They will receive a set number each semester. Based on the feedback from our user research, we decided to go with a phone application for the solution. This solution satisfies the requirements for all three parties(consumers, providers, and GT Dining services) involved and the design criterias. This app would allow Georgia Tech students to sign in with their credentials and send meal swipes to their friends, donate to a shelter, or cater personal events.

            <p>
              Our team realized that the issues regarding leftover meal swipes was a rampant issue in the Georgia Tech community. We listened to all sides of the problem space and implemented features into our application that satisfies everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we were to do this project all over again, we would focus on the legal issues that we weren’t able to completely solve for our sharing economy. In the beginning, we weren't aware that students are not allowed to share swipes with one another. As we delved deeper into our problem space, we talked to GT Dining Services later in our project. However, if we were given the opportunity again, knowing the extremity of the problem, we would have gone to the GT Dining Services earlier and asked for their participation in ideas so that this solution could actually be made available for GT students.
