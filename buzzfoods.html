                A lot of students at Georgia Tech purchase meal plans, particularly freshmen, who are required to purchase one. At current rates, freshmen are required to pay <span class = "emphasize">$2,420 per semester</span> for a meal plan. Meal plans consist of a number of meal swipes that expire by the end of the semester.

                Students who are running out of time to use up their remaining meal swipes have few options. Many use their meal swipes at fast food restaurants located on campus. Students also use their meal swipes to buy food for their friends, but they might not have many friends who are not on the meal plan or their friends may also be stuck in the same situation as them.

            We sent out a survey to our friends at Georgia Tech and also posted it in Georgia Tech Facebook groups. The survey isolated the meal plan participants from non-meal plan participants through a series of conditional questions. As part of the survey we recorded the class standing, gender, and residence area (on or off campus) in the event that statistically significant correlations between any of these factors and meal plan preferences could be found. Because anyone involved in paying for a meal plan is a stakeholder in the problem area, we asked meal plan holders how their meal plan was funded. Similarly, we asked non-meal plan holders if the cost of a meal plan played a part in their decision to not sign up for a meal plan.

          <div class = "mb-3">
            To determine if there was potential to address dissatisfaction on the part of the non-meal plan holding consumers, we asked them to indicate how satisfied they were with their current food arrangements, which could comprise cooking at home, eating out, or some other system. The idea behind this was that respondees who were not satisfied with their current food plans would be more open to changing the way they get their food than someone who doesn’t feel like making any changes.

                In the beginning of this project, we wanted consumers to be able to purchase meal swipes at a much reduced rate from producers. However, after talking with GT Dining services, we learned that Meal swipes are tax-exempt and the person who buys them has tax implications that are non-transferable. However, there are ways to circumvent these rules without breaking them, i.e, limiting the amount of meal swipes one can donate.
              </div>

              <div class = "mb-3">
                With this in mind, we modified the donation solution to limit the number of swipes the users can donate. The swipes they donate are part of a “Guest Meal Plan Swipe,” which are swipes specifically set aside for donating. They will receive a set number each semester. Based on the feedback from our user research, we decided to go with a phone application for the solution.

                This solution satisfies the requirements for all three parties(consumers, providers, and GT Dining services) involved and the design criterias.

              Our team realized that the issues regarding leftover meal swipes was a rampant issue in the Georgia Tech community. We listened to all sides of the problem space and implemented features into our application that satisfies everyone.

              If we were to do this project all over again, we would focus on the legal issues that we weren’t able to completely solve for our sharing economy. In the beginning, we weren't aware that students are not allowed to share swipes with one another. As we delved deeper into our problem space, we talked to GT Dining Services later in our project. However, if we were given the opportunity again, knowing the extremity of the problem, we would have gone to the GT Dining Services earlier and asked for their participation in ideas so that this solution could actually be made available for GT students.
