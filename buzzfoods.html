                    I, along with Bryanna Lawton, Vicky Chung, and Naren Dikkala, was tasked with finding and solving a problem in the "sharing economy" - a system that will help both producers and consumers receive what they each want.

                  <p>
                    A lot of students at Georgia Tech purchase meal plans, particularly freshmen, who are required to purchase one. At current rates, freshmen are required to pay $2,420 per semester for a meal plan. This is a significant amount of money, considering that tuition for a full-time in-state undergraduate student is $5,004 (also at current rates). A meal plan is 48% of the cost of tuition, yet the value proposition is questionable because meal swipes expire at the end of each semester. So per annum, freshman must pay $4,840 for 700 meals, and cannot redeem any value if they do not use these meals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Presently, students who are running out of time to use meal swipes have few options. Many try to buy food from Chik-fil-A or Panda Express, as these two outlets accept meal swipes towards the end of the semester. However, this is limited to one swipe per day, and has a value of $7, versus a retail value of up to $15 for a meal swipe at dinner time. Additionally, fast food is not healthy, so students are loading up on unhealthy food before finals, which is not good for academic performance. Another possibility is that students may try to give meal swipes to their friends, but they might not have many friends who lack meal plans (if they are freshman) or their friends may also be stuck with extra meals, or may not be interested in meals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our goal is to design a system which will allow students to share meals they don’t need or plan on using, with other students at variable rates. Similar to electric grid pricing, the system would peak during periods of heavy traffic to the dining halls, or when there is the greatest number of students looking for meals, and drop when there is less traffic at the dining halls. This way, the dining halls wouldn’t be overwhelmed with people buying meals along with the regular meal plans, and they would instead be better utilizing their facilities over time with the system encouraging more traffic during times of traditionally less usage.

                        <p>
                          We sent out a survey to our friends at Georgia Tech and also posted it in Georgia Tech Facebook groups. The survey isolated the meal plan participants from non-meal plan participants through a series of conditional questions. As part of the survey we recorded the class standing, gender, and residence area (on or off campus) in the event that statistically significant correlations between any of these factors and meal plan preferences could be found. Because anyone involved in paying for a meal plan is a stakeholder in the problem area, we asked meal plan holders how their meal plan was funded. Similarly, we asked non-meal plan holders if the cost of a meal plan played a part in their decision to not sign up for a meal plan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          To determine if there was potential to address dissatisfaction on the part of the non-meal plan holding consumers, we asked them to indicate how satisfied they were with their current food arrangements, which could comprise cooking at home, eating out, or some other system. The idea behind this was that respondees who were not satisfied with their current food plans would be more open to changing the way they get their food than someone who doesn’t feel like making any changes.
